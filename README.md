1ðŸ’¥Diabetes Prediction: My internship involved developing a diabetes disease classification model by applying machine learning techniques to medical data. The goal was to create an accurate predictive model for identifying the presence of diabetes.

2ðŸ’¥Bitcoin Price Prediction: In parallel with my health-related responsibilities, I undertook a financial challenge during my internship. Specifically, I addressed a Bitcoin price regression problem, concentrating on the analysis of closing price and volume. The objective was to develop a comprehensive model that could offer valuable insights into stock prices and enhance the predictive capabilities for Bitcoin prices

3 ðŸ’¥Major Project: Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform: At the heart of my internship was a compelling project centered on predictive analysis and customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform. In the context of the burgeoning trend in online shopping, understanding customer behavior has become paramount. I applied data-driven insights to segment customers according to their preferences and purchase patterns. This strategic initiative empowered the platform to enhance the overall shopping experience by tailoring its offerings.
