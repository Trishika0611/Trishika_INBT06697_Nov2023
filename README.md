1ðŸ’¥Diabetes Prediction: My internship involved developing a diabetes disease classification model by applying machine learning techniques to medical data. The goal was to create an accurate predictive model for identifying the presence of diabetes.

2ðŸ’¥Bitcoin Price Prediction: In parallel with my health-related responsibilities, I undertook a financial challenge during my internship. Specifically, I addressed a Bitcoin price regression problem, concentrating on the analysis of closing price and volume. The objective was to develop a comprehensive model that could offer valuable insights into stock prices and enhance the predictive capabilities for Bitcoin prices

3 ðŸ’¥Major Project: Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform: The centerpiece of my internship was a compelling project focused on predictive analysis and customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform. Given the surge in online shopping, understanding customer behavior has become paramount. I leveraged data-driven insights to segment customers based on their preferences and purchase patterns. This initiative empowered the platform to customize its offerings, thereby enhancing the overall shopping experience.

I express sincere gratitude to the entire team at #iNeuBytes for their warm welcome, collaborative spirit, and unwavering support throughout my engagement. The camaraderie and synergy within the team, particularly in the realm of #Datascience, greatly contributed to a positive and enriching experience. The shared commitment to excellence and mutual support fostered a productive environment that enhanced both personal and professional growth.
